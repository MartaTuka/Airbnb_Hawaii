Costa Rica. Jamaica. Bahamas. Yellowstone Park, etc... At the end of one trip, I'm just counting until the next excursion somewhere exciting.  I can't live without traveling. It's in my nomadic nature to roam and never stay in one place.  From food to culture to natural wonders, I love and desire the flavors of the world on my tongue, I love and desire to be immersed in a wholly different culture, and I want to see, hear and feel the natural wonders that surround us. With my loving husband and my two boys we travel at every opportunity and we enjoy snowboarding, surfing, sightseeing. We are fond of Hawaii and have been to three of the islands (Oahu, Maui, Kauai) more times than we can count. 
As a Host on AirBnb, we offer where we go and where we have been so we know what our Guests might experience during their stay. As a result, we have the highest confidence that our Guests' stay will be a truly wonderful experience.

Naoise's an Irish guy who likes traveling & the great outdoors too, but also has a love for art, music, movies, social media and fashion.

Our little boy Nainoa is 5 yrs old now and still loves meeting all the guests!  He  spends a lot of time outdoors going beach, and recently started fishing and doing some mountain biking.

We have a new baby girl Lilinoe who just turned one in 2017.  She is adorable and has the cutest personality!  She's more shy than her brother when meeting new people but is very playful after warming up!

Kea is a Japanese Spitz who just likes running around off the leash somewhere outside and eating really good food!  She loves people too!

We are Delamarie & Kepeli Robbins. 
Really quick statement we have to say....

In Hawaii, unfortunately, we have homeless people everywhere. 
across the street of our apartments is a handicap living situation and although they live in the building, they enjoy the fresh air outside and like hanging out in the parking lot. They're honestly the nicer people here in Hawaii, although you may think they're homeless.  We do ask you not to judge these sweet souls. 

We are a happily married couple with grown children and have adopted a baby boy. Hunter is now 8 years old.  We have 18 beautiful grandchildren, 2 fur babies, *Bugsie and KalaPuna, who live upstairs and do not share common areas, 3 kitty cats, Mainge,   Boots and Butters who lives outside......
We are competitive bodybuilders and have our own private training center. We also have the best supplements money can buy.  

Smoking in designated area only.  No smoking in or by our house or apartments 

We have three locations....
1.) Our home.... it is bi level, so our guests have lots of privacy as well as we do.  
With a private fenced-in yard and an amazing swimming pool, you can have a great time here without even leaving the yard. 

2.) Our apartments offer a full kitchen and bath. 

Both our home and apartments are centrally located, and 7-10 minutes away from the airport is perfect for anyone with or without a vehicle. 
Bus stop literally a 2-minute walk away. 
We have kayaks and surfboards that you can use free of charge. Have lots of advice too -

*** Private rooms with a shared bathroom and common areas.

One of which was Oahu many years ago, and I have returned to Hawaii to be with my eldest son and his lovely wife.

My hobbies include portrait art, and I find it's always rewarding to provide people with portraits of their loved ones, including pets.  I taught myself to use pastels which is a beautiful soft medium for capturing precious memories. 

My occupation for many years was clinical support for Home Health Care, but I have always cleaned and organized for fun and profit!  Before that, I worked with middle school children in a charter school environment, teaching them how to clean and maintain their school.  I found them to be very responsive to guidance and learning, gaining respect for themselves and others.

All the skills I've developed seemed to translate quite nicely into being an Airbnb Host.  It is so rewarding when people leave happy and pleased with their stay!  ",within an hour,100.0

Really quick statement we have to say....

In Hawaii, unfortunately, we have homeless people everywhere. 
across the street of our apartments is a handicap living situation and although they live in the building, they enjoy the fresh air outside and like hanging out in the parking lot. They're honestly the nicer people here in Hawaii, although you may think they're homeless.  We do ask you not to judge these sweet souls. 

We are a happily married couple with grown children and have adopted a baby boy. Hunter is now 8 years old.  We have 18 beautiful grandchildren, 2 fur babies, *Bugsie and KalaPuna, who live upstairs and do not share common areas, 3 kitty cats, Mainge,   Boots and Butters who lives outside......
We are competitive bodybuilders and have our own private training center. We also have the best supplements money can buy.  

Smoking in designated area only.  No smoking in or by our house or apartments 

We have three locations....
1.) Our home.... it is bi level, so our guests have lots of privacy as well as we do.  
With a private fenced-in yard and an amazing swimming pool, you can have a great time here without even leaving the yard. 

2.) Our apartments offer a full kitchen and bath. 

Both our home and apartments are centrally located, and 7-10 minutes away from the airport is perfect for anyone with or without a vehicle. 
Bus stop literally a 2-minute walk away. 
We have kayaks and surfboards that you can use free of charge. Have lots of advice too -

*** Private rooms with a shared bathroom and common areas.
*** Our K suite unit is completely private.  
We use scented laundry detergent and have plugins when available.
3.) Up country...total country vibe away from the hustle and bustle. Cooler place

Really quick statement we have to say....

In Hawaii, unfortunately, we have homeless people everywhere. 
across the street of our apartments is a handicap living situation and although they live in the building, they enjoy the fresh air outside and like hanging out in the parking lot. They're honestly the nicer people here in Hawaii, although you may think they're homeless.  We do ask you not to judge these sweet souls. 

We are a happily married couple with grown children and have adopted a baby boy. Hunter is now 8 years old.  We have 18 beautiful grandchildren, 2 fur babies, *Bugsie and KalaPuna, who live upstairs and do not share common areas, 3 kitty cats, Mainge,   Boots and Butters who lives outside......
We are competitive bodybuilders and have our own private training center. We also have the best supplements money can buy.  

Smoking in designated area only.  No smoking in or by our house or apartments 

We have three locations....
1.) Our home.... it is bi level, so our guests have lots of privacy as well as we do.  
With a private fenced-in yard and an amazing swimming pool, you can have a great time here without even leaving the yard. 

2.) Our apartments offer a full kitchen and bath. 

Both our home and apartments are centrally located, and 7-10 minutes away from the airport is perfect for anyone with or without a vehicle. 
Bus stop literally a 2-minute walk away. 
We have kayaks and surfboards that you can use free of charge. Have lots of advice too -

*** Private rooms with a shared bathroom and common areas.
*** Our K suite unit is completely private.  
We use scented laundry detergent and have plugins when available.
3.) Up country...total country vibe away from the hustle and bustle. Cooler place

One of the questions that's asked is, ""What are 5 things you can't live without?""
Honestly, the answer to that is simple 
1. God
2. My husband/ family 
3. Trust
4. Health
5. Happiness 

We have worked long and hard and now do a lot of traveling, so we leave our hard-working assistant, Kevin, to help you with all of your needs when we are not here. 
At our home......
Just FYI, NO AIR CONDITIONING or KITCHEN. TOTALLY FENCED IN YARD MEANING YOU'LL HAVE TO OPEN AND CLOSE GATE WHEN LEAVING AND ARRIVING. PULL UP ONTO THE SIDE OF ROAD PUT YOUR FLASHERS ON SLIDE GATE OPEN. SAME WHEN LEAVING at our home.

At our apartments......
Our second location is located above our gym and has FULL KITCHEN and a bath. still NO AIR-CONDITIONING.  Free coffee and tea. Please Park on the right side of the building.

Each room offers different options, so read it carefully.

 Thank you for your consideration.

We are Delamarie & Kepeli Robbins. 
Really quick statement we have to say....

In Hawaii, unfortunately, we have homeless people everywhere. 
across the street of our apartments is a handicap living situation and although they live in the building, they enjoy the fresh air outside and like hanging out in the parking lot. They're honestly the nicer people here in Hawaii, although you may think they're homeless.  We do ask you not to judge these sweet souls. 

We are a happily married couple with grown children and have adopted a baby boy. Hunter is now 8 years old.  We have 18 beautiful grandchildren, 2 fur babies, *Bugsie and KalaPuna, who live upstairs and do not share common areas, 3 kitty cats, Mainge,   Boots and Butters who lives outside......
We are competitive bodybuilders and have our own private training center. We also have the best supplements money can buy.  

Smoking in designated area only.  No smoking in or by our house or apartments 

We have three locations....
1.) Our home.... it is bi level, so our guests have lots of privacy as well as we do.  
With a private fenced-in yard and an amazing swimming pool, you can have a great time here without even leaving the yard. 

2.) Our apartments offer a full kitchen and bath. 

Both our home and apartments are centrally located, and 7-10 minutes away from the airport is perfect for anyone with or without a vehicle. 
Bus stop literally a 2-minute walk away. 
We have kayaks and surfboards that you can use free of charge. Have lots of advice too -

*** Private rooms with a shared bathroom and common areas.
*** Our K suite unit is completely private.  
We use scented laundry detergent and have plugins when available.
3.) Up country...total country vibe away from the hustle and bustle. Cooler place

One of the questions that's asked is, ""What are 5 things you can't live without?""
Honestly, the answer to that is simple 
1. God
2. My husband/ family 
3. Trust
4. Health
5. Happiness 

We have worked long and hard and now do a lot of traveling, so we leave our hard-working assistant, Kevin, to help you with all of your needs when we are not here. 
At our home......
Just FYI, NO AIR CONDITIONING or KITCHEN. TOTALLY FENCED IN YARD MEANING YOU'LL HAVE TO OPEN AND CLOSE GATE WHEN LEAVING AND ARRIVING. PULL UP ONTO THE SIDE OF ROAD PUT YOUR FLASHERS ON SLIDE GATE OPEN. SAME WHEN LEAVING at our home.

At our apartments......
Our second location is located above our gym and has FULL KITCHEN and a bath. still NO AIR-CONDITIONING.  Free coffee and tea. Please Park on the right side of the building.

Each room offers different options, so read it carefully.

 Thank you for your consideration.

We are Delamarie & Kepeli Robbins. 
Really quick statement we have to say....

In Hawaii, unfortunately, we have homeless people everywhere. 
across the street of our apartments is a handicap living situation and although they live in the building, they enjoy the fresh air outside and like hanging out in the parking lot. They're honestly the nicer people here in Hawaii, although you may think they're homeless.  We do ask you not to judge these sweet souls. 

We are a happily married couple with grown children and have adopted a baby boy. Hunter is now 8 years old.  We have 18 beautiful grandchildren, 2 fur babies, *Bugsie and KalaPuna, who live upstairs and do not share common areas, 3 kitty cats, Mainge,   Boots and Butters who lives outside......
We are competitive bodybuilders and have our own private training center. We also have the best supplements money can buy.  

Smoking in designated area only.  No smoking in or by our house or apartments 

We have three locations....
1.) Our home.... it is bi level, so our guests have lots of privacy as well as we do.  
With a private fenced-in yard and an amazing swimming pool, you can have a great time here without even leaving the yard. 

2.) Our apartments offer a full kitchen and bath. 

Both our home and apartments are centrally located, and 7-10 minutes away from the airport is perfect for anyone with or without a vehicle. 
Bus stop literally a 2-minute walk away. 
We have kayaks and surfboards that you can use free of charge. Have lots of advice too -

*** Private rooms with a shared bathroom and common areas.
*** Our K suite unit is completely private.  
We use scented laundry detergent and have plugins when available.
3.) Up country...total country vibe away from the hustle and bustle. Cooler place

One of the questions that's asked is, ""What are 5 things you can't live without?""
Honestly, the answer to that is simple 
1. God
2. My husband/ family 
3. Trust
4. Health
5. Happiness 

We have worked long and hard and now do a lot of traveling, so we leave our hard-working assistant, Kevin, to help you with all of your needs when we are not here. 
At our home......
Just FYI, NO AIR CONDITIONING or KITCHEN. TOTALLY FENCED IN YARD MEANING YOU'LL HAVE TO OPEN AND CLOSE GATE WHEN LEAVING AND ARRIVING. PULL UP ONTO THE SIDE OF ROAD PUT YOUR FLASHERS ON SLIDE GATE OPEN. SAME WHEN LEAVING at our home.

At our apartments......
Our second location is located above our gym and has FULL KITCHEN and a bath. still NO AIR-CONDITIONING.  Free coffee and tea. Please Park on the right side of the building.

Each room offers different options, so read it carefully.

 Thank you for your consideration.

Being able to get together every Sunday to cook and enjoy each other is something I don’t take for granted.  Love the ocean, with my favorite past time now which is stand up paddle boarding. I was a Dental Assistant for a total of 18 yrs, then quit to help my husband run his construction company. Never did I think I would be doing a bnb, (always have done long term) but oh how I enjoy it!!

My husband and I have been doing Airbnb
for several years at another property
in a village north of here that we have sold.
We bought this Aeolian Ranch guesthouse property
December 2019. It is amazing. 3.5 acres of peaceful 
horse pasture land with a big house with
several bedrooms. We remodeled 
everything so you will enjoy your room
updated and lovely. we
added two more bathrooms so no one
will ever have to wait! Three total.
THE VIEW FROM OUR HOME IS AMAZING.
Giant panoramic ocean view.
Our spot  is very secluded and tranquil.
No neighbors ors next door, no noise. Really quiet.

The 10-acre ocean-view property is blessed with average daytime temperatures of 85° F year-round, and 65° F at night, with cool, fragrant trade winds, surrounding tropical flora, including old growth mangoes, nearby swimming, surfing and snorkeling.

This property was once a papaya farm and is now newly planted with bamboo, papaya, palms, banana and many other fruit trees. The octagonal Balinese meditation pavilion is set among shade-trees with an expansive view of the ocean. The island wildlife is all around us – a variety of birds by day and at night there's the pleasant chirping of Coqui frogs – and there are no snakes. Natural wonders include Volcanoes National Park, for lava and crater viewing, volcanically heated warm ponds and steam vents (as outdoor saunas) and other wonders of the lush tropics.

Kmec opened in the summer of 2008 for pre-arranged seasonal meditation retreats and private meditation-vacations on request. Additionally, we would like to extend our welcome to Big Island travelers offering cozy cottages and open air kitchen and bath. We offer daily free meditation instructions and practices at our beautiful Balinese meditation pavillion. Additionally, we offer Yoga and nature tours upon guest's request (donations accepted).

The farm offers me and my guests, a peaceful, quiet, farm stay on aina (land) that is deeply rooted in the old Hawaiian traditions and ways of Aloha. I danced hula with Halau 'O KeikiAli'i and I grow gourds for making Ipu Heke (gourd implements used by hula dancers).

Vacation Home Management

Vacasa unlocks the possibilities of how we enjoy vacation homes. We take care of managing our homeowners’ vacation houses so they can have peace of mind (and their home when they want to). And our guests book vacations confidently knowing they’re going to find exactly what they’re looking for without any surprises.

Each vacation home is always cared for by our professional local teams who implement our high cleanliness and maintenance values, while the hands-off tasks of vacation rental management--marketing, filing taxes, and maintaining a website--are handled by a specialized central support team. Our passion and focus remain true: to empower our homeowners, guests, and employees to invest in vacation.",within an hour,100.0

I have traveled more than 30 countries so far and the number is still increasing! I have home stayed in US, UK, Spain, Italy, Switzerland and Australia.

Through these experiences, I learned, ""when in Rome, do as the Romans do"" attitude. This definitely makes it easier to accept whatever happens during the trip and makes it more fun.

I love traveling and meeting new people and culture. When free, I would be happy to assist the guests as much as I can to make their stay memorable.

そんな旅行やホームステイの経験から学んだのが、”郷に入っては郷に従う”という姿勢です。これが根本にあると、旅行中に起こる全てのことに寛容になれ、楽しめます。

Years in the making, we have lived on the property since 1976 starting out in an old plantation cottage.  When it burned down we built another small home and then subdivided the property to put in the long driveway into the back portion of the property.

Our beloved family home was designed and built in 1989 with an “old Hawaii” essence to capture the incredible view of Black Mountain and the Pacific ocean beyond.  As our children became young adults and went off to college, every summer or Christmas vacation they would return with their friends.  No one ever wanted to leave.  In fact, after college, all the children eventually came back home, married, started families and built homes on the property.

With a very, large empty ""nest"", we felt the house and setting so special it should be shared, and that is how Kauai Banyan Inn came to be.  Having been in the hospitality business for 40 years and enjoying the interaction with guests and sharing the beautiful Island with them,  it was a natural transition for us to turn our home into a bed and breakfast inn.  

The Kauai Banyan Inn is a family operation, with daughter-in-laws helping us with the daily operations and our sons and grandsons help with the landscape and property maintenance.

Sustainability is Important to Us
Since 2018, Kauai Banyan Inn is “powered by the sun” with a complete solar system installation, furthering our goal of energy efficiency and sustainability.  We have also been recognized by the National Wildlife Federation as a certified Wildlife Habitat because of our planning, landscape and sustainable gardening practices which support wildlife in finding quality habitat (food, water, cover) and places to raise their young.

Years in the making, we have lived on the property since 1976 starting out in an old plantation cottage.  When it burned down we built another small home and then subdivided the property to put in the long driveway into the back portion of the property.

Our beloved family home was designed and built in 1989 with an “old Hawaii” essence to capture the incredible view of Black Mountain and the Pacific ocean beyond.  As our children became young adults and went off to college, every summer or Christmas vacation they would return with their friends.  No one ever wanted to leave.  In fact, after college, all the children eventually came back home, married, started families and built homes on the property.

With a very, large empty ""nest"", we felt the house and setting so special it should be shared, and that is how Kauai Banyan Inn came to be.  Having been in the hospitality business for 40 years and enjoying the interaction with guests and sharing the beautiful Island with them,  it was a natural transition for us to turn our home into a bed and breakfast inn.  

The Kauai Banyan Inn is a family operation, with daughter-in-laws helping us with the daily operations and our sons and grandsons help with the landscape and property maintenance.

Sustainability is Important to Us
Since 2018, Kauai Banyan Inn is “powered by the sun” with a complete solar system installation, furthering our goal of energy efficiency and sustainability.  We have also been recognized by the National Wildlife Federation as a certified Wildlife Habitat because of our planning, landscape and sustainable gardening practices which support wildlife in finding quality habitat (food, water, cover) and places to raise their young.

Kauai Banyan Inn has been a labor of love for our family for many years.  We look forward to welcoming you with Aloha to this very special place in paradise!

'Ua mau ke ea o ka'aina i ka pono o Hawaii'  -- The life of the land in Hawaii is preserved in righteousness.
'Aloha mai no, aloha aku; o ka huhu ka mea e ola ' ole ai' ---When love is given, love should be returned; anger is the thing that gives no life.

I moved to the Big Island in 1993 from Guam after serving a short stint in the USCG during the Golf War,  then worked as an acute care nurse at our local Hilo hospital for the last 22 years.  

Ive remained mesmerized by this island’s amazing natural beauty, diverse ecosystems, terrains, and love the laid back lifestyle it provides which easily translated into me transforming my house to one I can happily and proudly share with those seeking to explore and experience this amazing island in a relaxed home setting.  

I'm originally  from the Micronesian Island of Yap,  known for its pristine water, manta ray dives ( check out the world-famous  Yap Divers ) and  its colorful and spirited bamboo war dance performed by bare chested natives in lion clothes and grass skirts, something I grew up doing.   
I embrace  cultural diversity and truly enjoy meeting people from all walks of life and all regions in the world.  I take pride in my house and the service that I provide my guests. I value my precious 'free' time by sneaking in sporadic reading here and there  and enjoying the outdoors; camping, hiking, swimming, kayaking, paddle board, and gardening, but most of all, I love traveling and looking forward to seeing a lot more of this amazing world we live in and experience different cultures along the way.

I’m always striving for a balanced lifestyle; healthy living through heath conscious cooking utilizing locally grown, ( a lot are my own home grown) produce, keeping physically active, and inner peace and serenity.

At Starseed Ranch under HIP ag,  we host farm field trips for local school groups and farmer training workshops.

Starseed Ranch has a vibrant history of sustainability and community, and we are honored to serve as stewards. This land has always held a special place in our hearts as we were married here in 2011, and have returned many times over the years to spend time with the previous owners, Jyoti and Andre. We have been hosting overnight lodging and special events since 2019,  and are excited to welcome more people to this beautiful and sacred place. Please look around and let us know if you have any questions. We look forward to hosting you at Starseed Ranch soon!

We both have had many worldly adventures that allowed us to stay at lots of cool airbnbs which helped us to create our own oasis here to share with others :) I’m originally from a small town in Minnesota but have spent the last couple of years in Seattle studying Medical Anthropology & Global Health at the University of Washington Seattle and whitewater rafting.

     I share the property with 2 dogs.  Felicia who is very friendly, and Tulu Hound, who thinks he is the head of security.  Once he realizes you belong here, he quickly warms up.  The house was designed by the late Dennis Preston Davis, an architect specializing in solar powered homes. I am an avid gardener and have a large collection of tropical plants. I have traveled the world extensively, experiencing its diverse cultures and natural wonders, and it is reflected in my home.

I had always wanted to live in Hood River and finally made that happen by buying ""Hood River Suites & Extended Stay Apartments"" in 1999.  

Hood  River Suites & Extended Stay Apartments were a 9 unit 1-bedroom apartment building that I converted into vacation rentals.  Located at 709 Cascade Ave (7th/Cascade) in the heart of downtown Hood River.  I also rent my house at 922 Oak St out when I am not using it.   More pictures and area info are available on the site hoodriversuites 

My properties are legal rentals registered in the City of Hood River and I pay the 8% city and 1.8% state transient lodging tax.  My rates are higher and odd numbers because I include the tax in the rate.  

Example:  $141 per night is $130 per night plus $11.70 tax but air bnb won't list it as 141.70.   ",within a day,100.0

I had always wanted to live in Hood River and finally made that happen by buying ""Hood River Suites & Extended Stay Apartments"" in 1999.  

Hood  River Suites & Extended Stay Apartments were a 9 unit 1-bedroom apartment building that I converted into vacation rentals.  Located at 709 Cascade Ave (7th/Cascade) in the heart of downtown Hood River.  I also rent my house at 922 Oak St out when I am not using it.   More pictures and area info are available on the site hoodriversuites 

My properties are legal rentals registered in the City of Hood River and I pay the 8% city and 1.8% state transient lodging tax.  My rates are higher and odd numbers because I include the tax in the rate.  

Example:  $141 per night is $130 per night plus $11.70 tax but air bnb won't list it as 141.70.   ",within a day,100.0

Salut! こんにちは! I am a local ""hapa"" (half Okinawan, half French).

I started out as an RN, wandered into the U. Of Hawai'i faculty system, and then... fell in love with teaching, learning, and educational design; especially alternative and web-based solutions.

My passions are endless: mixed media art, reading, technology, knitting, power tools, gardening, skiing, hiking, biking, camping, travel, volunteerism, baseball, Broadway, cooking, entertaining and TGIF's!

After spending most of my life in the islands and in empty-nest mode, I am designing the second half to explore mainland opportunities and travel more. 

I have always loved having a ""home"" in the islands to welcome mainland, inter-island, and international family and friends. Air B&B is the perfect opportunity to being able to welcome and host them in our now empty rooms, enabling everyone to enjoy all of what we islanders love about living here.

With Hawai'i's new short stay accommodation laws, we are only able to host 30-day or longer reservations. However, this does not affect our typical long-staying guests who come to the island for graduate program rotations, intern or externships, travel medical staff contracts, sabbaticals, grandparent month-long visits, etc.

Our goal is to provide a turnkey furnished and supplied island home for your 30-99 day time on O'ahu so that all you need to fly over with are your carryon of clothes and cell phone.

Please know, under the current pandemic circumstances, we are following all the federal, state, county, city and AirBnB mandates and policies along with our own home requirements to help all of us be good global and Honolulu citizens. Please send me a inquiry to run by your plans with me to consult with the most current policies.",within a few hours,100.0

Originally from the Midwest, I did a stint in the military, which brought me to the islands in 1978.  My education includes an AA in Foreign Languages, a BA in Psychology and completion of a Master's program in Guidance & Counseling. 
 
I'm a Christian, who believes the good Lord brought me to this fantastic place.
I love the serene beauty and quiet of this location, and since the house is much larger than one person needs, wish to share it with traveling guests,  who will also enjoy its comfort and fabulous views.  Besides that, the horses still ""eat like horses"", even though they are no longer earning their keep!

As a pet lover, I would prefer folks who also like animals.  Because I have so many, I don't have a chance to travel much, although in the past I did get the opportunity to visit Spain, France, Switzerland  and England.  I was stationed in Florida & CA as well as Hawaii while in the military.   

I enjoy a variety of books and movies, preferably well-written and thought-provoking.  A good comedy is always appreciated, as well.  My social life now is mostly a weekly ladies' luncheon and music nights at the Fifties Café.",within an hour,100.0

For 16 years I offered horseback rides on Oahu, but moved to the Big Island with my horses when the ranch lease recently expired. 

Originally from the Midwest, I did a stint in the military, which brought me to the islands in 1978.  My education includes an AA in Foreign Languages, a BA in Psychology and completion of a Master's program in Guidance & Counseling. 
 
I'm a Christian, who believes the good Lord brought me to this fantastic place.
I love the serene beauty and quiet of this location, and since the house is much larger than one person needs, wish to share it with traveling guests,  who will also enjoy its comfort and fabulous views.  Besides that, the horses still ""eat like horses"", even though they are no longer earning their keep!

As a pet lover, I would prefer folks who also like animals.  Because I have so many, I don't have a chance to travel much, although in the past I did get the opportunity to visit Spain, France, Switzerland  and England.  I was stationed in Florida & CA as well as Hawaii while in the military.   

I enjoy a variety of books and movies, preferably well-written and thought-provoking.  A good comedy is always appreciated, as well.  My social life now is mostly a weekly ladies' luncheon and music nights at the Fifties Café.",within an hour,100.0

Salut! こんにちは! I am a local ""hapa"" (half Okinawan, half French).

I started out as an RN, wandered into the U. Of Hawai'i faculty system, and then... fell in love with teaching, learning, and educational design; especially alternative and web-based solutions.

My passions are endless: mixed media art, reading, technology, knitting, power tools, gardening, skiing, hiking, biking, camping, travel, volunteerism, baseball, Broadway, cooking, entertaining and TGIF's!

After spending most of my life in the islands and in empty-nest mode, I am designing the second half to explore mainland opportunities and travel more. 

I have always loved having a ""home"" in the islands to welcome mainland, inter-island, and international family and friends. Air B&B is the perfect opportunity to being able to welcome and host them in our now empty rooms, enabling everyone to enjoy all of what we islanders love about living here.

With Hawai'i's new short stay accommodation laws, we are only able to host 30-day or longer reservations. However, this does not affect our typical long-staying guests who come to the island for graduate program rotations, intern or externships, travel medical staff contracts, sabbaticals, grandparent month-long visits, etc.

Our goal is to provide a turnkey furnished and supplied island home for your 30-99 day time on O'ahu so that all you need to fly over with are your carryon of clothes and cell phone.

Please know, under the current pandemic circumstances, we are following all the federal, state, county, city and AirBnB mandates and policies along with our own home requirements to help all of us be good global and Honolulu citizens. Please send me a inquiry to run by your plans with me to consult with the most current policies.",within a few hours,100.0

Air B&B is the perfect opportunity to being able to welcome and host them in our now empty rooms, enabling everyone to enjoy all of what we islanders love about living here.

With Hawai'i's new short stay accommodation laws, we are only able to host 30-day or longer reservations. However, this does not affect our typical long-staying guests who come to the island for graduate program rotations, intern or externships, travel medical staff contracts, sabbaticals, grandparent month-long visits, etc.

Our goal is to provide a turnkey furnished and supplied island home for your 30-99 day time on O'ahu so that all you need to fly over with are your carryon of clothes and cell phone.

Salut! こんにちは! I am a local ""hapa"" (half Okinawan, half French).

I started out as an RN, wandered into the U. Of Hawai'i faculty system, and then... fell in love with teaching, learning, and educational design; especially alternative and web-based solutions.

My passions are endless: mixed media art, reading, technology, knitting, power tools, gardening, skiing, hiking, biking, camping, travel, volunteerism, baseball, Broadway, cooking, entertaining and TGIF's!

After spending most of my life in the islands and in empty-nest mode, I am designing the second half to explore mainland opportunities and travel more. 

I have always loved having a ""home"" in the islands to welcome mainland, inter-island, and international family and friends. Air B&B is the perfect opportunity to being able to welcome and host them in our now empty rooms, enabling everyone to enjoy all of what we islanders love about living here.

With Hawai'i's new short stay accommodation laws, we are only able to host 30-day or longer reservations. However, this does not affect our typical long-staying guests who come to the island for graduate program rotations, intern or externships, travel medical staff contracts, sabbaticals, grandparent month-long visits, etc.

Our goal is to provide a turnkey furnished and supplied island home for your 30-99 day time on O'ahu so that all you need to fly over with are your carryon of clothes and cell phone.

Please know, under the current pandemic circumstances, we are following all the federal, state, county, city and AirBnB mandates and policies along with our own home requirements to help all of us be good global and Honolulu citizens. Please send me a inquiry to run by your plans with me to consult with the most current policies.",within a few hours,100.0
