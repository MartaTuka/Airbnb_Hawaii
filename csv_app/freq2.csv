Maui Vision is a business I love because I get to share the Aloha Spirit, the beauty of the land, and talk story with people from around the world. It is nice to know that we can contribute to someone’s Hawaiian vacation experience in a positive way. We love to hear back from our happy guests.

I used to live on the island of Oahu with my US Navy family when I was young.  We later moved to Southern California.  I knew one day I would return to Hawaii, the place I fell in love with long ago. I took a leap of faith and purchased my Maui condo June 2002 this was the beginning of fulfilling her prophecy to once again return to Hawaii soil.

I am a tropical expression artist who paints on canvas and etched metal.  My work is inspired by the beauty of the islands and has been displayed in several Maui art galleries over the years.  I am a writer and have my first book on Amazon.  I recently took up hula dancing and love to immerse myself in the culture and grace of this island.

2449,52896140,Jason,"Over the years I picked up several timeshares at amazing resorts that was not always able to use so I started renting them on Airbnb.
